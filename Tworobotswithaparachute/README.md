# Tworobotswithaparachute

I chose another approach which I used by utilizing a flag. Goal was the same, our robot must reach parachute and the other at the end. If robot find parachute, robot doesn’t do operation which is no movement in 1 unit time. And robot starts moving in opposite direction. If robot doesn’t find parachuteLocationOfTheOtherRobot, robot moves right. I assumed why parachute location of other robot. After I thought, the robot can’t find or encounter own parachute after landing point hence, I used finding parachute only for other robot. Besides, if robot doesn’t find parachute and move opposite, it moves left. When I run my code, it needs steps for both robot to move left at first. The problem took place in 1 dimensional plane. In my code it is (-1000,1000) to run and see output fast. Also, I calculated the number of steps to check. To sum up, I printed out the landing points for robot1 and robot2, where the robot2 is found, where the currentLocation of robot1 and currentLocation of the robot2 as a comment(line 56 and 62) and number of steps. I used ‘this’ keyword refer to the current instance of the class. But after I commented line 56 and 62, I didn’t have to use this. If you want to see the all steps you have uncomment line 56 and 62. I added weMeetAt value to show where they meet.
